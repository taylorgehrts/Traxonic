# Traxonic
Traxonic is a collaborative file sharing and collaboration app for musicians.  It allows users to define projects that contain files and collaborators, allowing musicians to send files back and forth to work on tracks together.  There is built in messaging within projects to allow collaborators to communicate during the creative process.
